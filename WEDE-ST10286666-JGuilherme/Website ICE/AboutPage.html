    <p>
    Our program/Cause is here to help spread there word and strive forward to help the Amazon Rainforest<br>
    and all living organisims that reside within that is why even a simple donation can help make a diffrence.<br>
    By helping us you are saving many species and indigenous people from starvation and a lack of shelter and<br>
    saving many trees from deforestation. We want to help engage the world in many ways of saving the Amazon<br>
    Rainforest. We plan to do this by getting people to help by Donations, Registering for our Outreach program<br>
    where they can help replant trees and help rebuild infrastructure of the indigenous peoples homes as well as<br>
    help them rebuild farms and there crop. This will help maintain the population from decreasing as well as the<br>
    Animals population becoming maintained. We also plan on taking species on the risk of extinction and taking them<br>
    to a rehabilation centre to keep them until there habitat can be restored so then we can keep watch of them and<br>
    feed them until they are ready to go back to the Rainforest. Here is a quick summary of what you can do to help.<br>
